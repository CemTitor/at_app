## Overview

at_app is the one-stop shop for Flutter developers developing with, or trying out the @platform.

This open source application is written in Dart, and is designed to help you run apps on the
@platform's decentralized, edge computing model. at_app can help you to:
- Build an app using our @platform application templates, which include the basic prerequisites
- Discover packages available on the @platform that may be useful to your project
- Quickly download and run a sample of an @platform package or demo app in 4 commands or less

Features of the @platform include:
- Cryptographic control of data access through personal data stores
- No application backend needed
- End to end encryption where only the data owner has the keys
- Private and surveillance free connectivity
- Integrate packages quickly and easily


We call giving people control of access to their data “flipping the internet”
and you can learn more about how it works by reading this
[overview](https://atsign.dev/docs/overview/).

## Get started

To get started, install the tool using pub:

```sh
flutter pub global activate at_app
```

*Additionally, pub may prompt you to add the global bin to your PATH variable, please do so before proceeding.

#### How it works

at_app uses a combination of `flutter create` as well as our own custom templating system to generate Flutter apps.

##### Usage

If you would like to see a particular package sample, check the readme of that package for instructions.

For complete usage, please see the example tab.
