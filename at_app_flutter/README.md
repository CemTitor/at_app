## Overview

at_app_flutter contains additional logic that applications generated by at_app use.

This open source package is written in Dart, supports Flutter and follows the
@‎platform's decentralized, edge computing model with the following features:
- Cryptographic control of data access through personal data stores
- No application backend needed
- End to end encryption where only the data owner has the keys
- Private and surveillance free connectivity

We call giving people control of access to their data “flipping the internet”
and you can learn more about how it works by reading this
[overview](https://atsign.dev/docs/overview/).

## Get started

This package is automatically included in your application when you generate an app using [at_app](https://pub.dev/packages/at_app). See the [at_app usage](https://pub.dev/packages/at_app/example) to learn how to generate an app that includes this package.

#### How it works

This package includes the `AtEnv` model which interprets @platform specific environment variables from a .env file.

##### Usage

See the [example tab](https://pub.dev/packages/at_app_flutter/example).
